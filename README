DESCRIPTION

This is a program developed for my friends who own a furniture manufacturing
company. The program is designed to manage a database of customer orders.

It was my first experiece with java and I worked in my spare time and in a
hurry, so I think some things are not very well designed.

1. Install Java Development Kit;

2. Download MySQL connector (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/);

3. Add the VectorApp home directory and the path to the MySQL connector
   to CLASSPATH environment variable (e.g.
   d:\vector;d:\vector\mysql-driver\mysql-connector-java-5.1.12-bin.jar).

4. Run javac VectorApp.java
